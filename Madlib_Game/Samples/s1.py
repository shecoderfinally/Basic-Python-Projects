and {verb2} really loudly.There are all \
sorts of {noun1} to play, like the {adjective1} {noun2} and the {noun3}.My instrument \
is the {adjective2} {musical_instrument1}, which sounds a lot like a {animal}.We are \
learning to {verb3} a song by The {noun4} \
called, 'I {verb4} to {verb5} with You,' \
using {musical_instrument2} and {noun5}.When we all {verb6} together, it sounds  like a \
{adjective3} group of {noun6}."
